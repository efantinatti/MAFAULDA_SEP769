# MAFAULDA_SEP769

This is a work based on the [MAFAULDA](http://www02.smt.ufrj.br/~offshore/mfs/page_01.html) project.

The main dataset files shall be found on [Kaggle - Machinery Fault Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uysalserkan/fault-induction-motor-dataset) 

## Description:

Based on the [MAFAULDA](http://www02.smt.ufrj.br/~offshore/mfs/page_01.html) project datased available also on [ Kaggle - Machinery Fault Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uysalserkan/fault-induction-motor-dataset), this project's main idea is to create a Deep Neural Network which will classify when the machine is running on its normal status or imbalanced status.

This database comprises on samples taken from a rate of 50 kHz scanning A/D device using the SpectraQuest Inc. Alignment/Balance Vibration Trainer (ABVT) Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS) as shown below:

## Dataset format:

This database is composed of 1951 multivariate time-series acquired by sensors on a SpectraQuest's Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS) Alignment-Balance-Vibration (ABVT). The 1951 comprises six different simulated states: normal function, imbalance fault, horizontal and vertical misalignment faults and, inner and outer bearing faults. This section describes the database.

The database is composed by several CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, each one with 8 columns, one column for each sensor, according to:

* column 1 - tachometer signal that allows to estimate rotation frequency;

* columns 2 to 4 - underhang bearing accelerometer (axial, radiale tangential direction);

* columns 5 to 7 - overhang bearing accelerometer (axial, radiale tangential direction);

* column 8 - microphone.

And making a simple exploratory analysis, that is what the data extract from the columns 2 to 7 looks like:

## Instructions:

1 - Download the dataset from [ Kaggle - Machinery Fault Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uysalserkan/fault-induction-motor-dataset). The files expected 'normal' and 'imbalance' datasets only.

2 - After you have cloned this repo, you should execute <XTZ.py>

3 - It will work on file ETL before training the model.

4 - If you wish and you can use our trained model CNNmodel.h5, LTSMmodel.h5

5 - Feel free to fork it too ;Ë†)
